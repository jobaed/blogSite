The microservices revolution has swept across the IT world over the past several years, with 71% of organizations reporting adopting the architecture by 2021. When discussing microservices, we often hear their advantages framed in terms of agility and flexibility in delivering innovations to customers. But one angle that’s not spoken about as much are enterprise security concerns.In the age of monolithic applications, a single security problem could mean hundreds or thousands of man-hours spent rebuilding an application from scratch. Along with having to patch out a security flaw itself, this also meant that DevOps and security teams would have to review and reconstruct the application to tweak dependencies — sometimes having to effectively reverse engineer entire applications.

Microservices have upended this paradigm. They allow DevOps to ring-fence security flaws or concerns and address them without worrying about breaking their entire application stack. This doesn’t just mean a quicker turnaround for security patches, but more resilient and efficient DevOps teams and IT stacks overall.
